Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal. Most exceptions are not
handled by programs; it is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. There are specific features
in Python to deal with exceptions and exception logic.

Note : exceptions have a rich type hierarchy, all inheriting from the BaseException type.
