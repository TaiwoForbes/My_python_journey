#   OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
*  Object Oriented Programming comes with four key princple which we should be aware of, these principles which are
* 1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to a mechanism of restricting the direct access to some of the attributes in a program
* 2. Abstraction: Its a concept in OOP that only shows the neccssary attribute and hides the unneccessary infromation from the instances. The main purpose of abstraction is to just hide unnecessay detsils to the iser
* 3. Inheritance: Its a mechanism that allows us to re-use code across all classes
* 4. polymorphism:  It refers to using a single type to refer to an entity to represent different type in different scenario. Basically, it refers to many forms POLY = MANY, MORPHISM = FORMS
